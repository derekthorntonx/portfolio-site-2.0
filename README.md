# Conversion of my initial portfolio website into a full-stack build. Built using React, Express, Node, and MongoDB.

Main purpose of the revision is to allow dynamic updates on projects, as well as general future-proofing. Given the option to adjust which projects are displayed on the front-page allows custom-tailored experiences depending on the needs at the time. Built a simple interface to automatically create and delete posts, as well as a filtering system to sort through various categories.

Authentication and authorization is handled through JWT, which upon successful log-in will be given and expire shortly after.
